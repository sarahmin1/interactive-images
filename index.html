      <p>Even after living in the United States for 43 years, Han-Young Song finds it difficult and often embarrassing to order food in English at American restaurants. And he never likes the Western-style entrees.</p>

      <p>Instead, the 77-year-old Song heads to the Korean Senior Center in Flushing, where he can purchase a Korean breakfast and lunch, for 75 cents and $1.50. Breakfast usually includes jook, or porridge, that ranges from savory to sweet, such as vegetable
        or red bean. Lunch includes rice, kimchi, soup and meat.</p>

      <p>"Even if it's the same meat, it's different," Song said, in Korean. "Here, beef has a Korean marinade. It's Korean-style cooking. There, they just serve a thick cut of steak."</p>

      <p>The Department for the Aging provided 7.2 million congregate meals to seniors through its 250 senior centers in 2017, after realizing an increasing need for culturally appropriate meals for immigrants. The DFTA distributes Korean meals in Queens,
        Spanish food in the Bronx and Chinese meals in Lower Manhattan.</p>

      <p>"There's definitely more demand than is being met now," said Margaret Chin, council member for District 1 and chairman for the Committee on Aging.</p>

      <p>More than 300 Korean seniors travel to the Korean Senior Center in Flushing to meet other Koreans, make new friends and play rounds of Go. Part of the demand is for senior centers to stay open for more than just weekdays. On Fridays, the center
        offers seniors extra bagged lunches to take home for the weekends.</p>

      <p>Some DFTA administrators worry, however, that there are health risks in senior and ethnic communities that are exacerbated by diet, especially ones that are rich in sodium. But Song disagrees, citing the conscientiousness of the Korean volunteers
        in the kitchen.</p>

      <p>"It's more healthy than going to a restaurant," Song said. "More healthy, no MSG."</p>
